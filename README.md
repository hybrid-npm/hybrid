# Hybrid

**Drop-in OpenClaw replacement with native XMTP messaging.**

Hybrid is a TypeScript agent runtime with **100% OpenClaw feature parity** — your `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, memory files, and skills work without modification. On top of that, you get a decentralized messaging layer via XMTP, a 3-layer PARA memory system, multi-user access control, and a channel adapter framework for connecting to any network.

Port your OpenClaw instance in under 10 minutes. Deploy to Fly.io, Cloudflare Workers, or any Node.js host.

---

## Why Hybrid

OpenClaw gave agents persistent memory, skills, and a scheduler. Hybrid keeps all of that and adds the missing pieces for real-world multi-user deployment:

- **Messaging** — agents live on XMTP, a decentralized messaging protocol. Users reach your agent from any XMTP-compatible app, no account required beyond a wallet.
- **Multi-user memory** — each user's memory is isolated by wallet address. Owners get full access; guests get their own private slice.
- **Structured knowledge** — beyond flat markdown files, Hybrid adds a PARA-based entity graph with atomic facts, decay tiers, and fact supersession.
- **Channel adapters** — XMTP today, Telegram or Slack tomorrow. A uniform adapter interface with local HTTP IPC, so channels are independently deployable.

## OpenClaw Compatibility

Everything that works in OpenClaw works in Hybrid. Same files, same format, same behavior.

## Quickstart

### Porting from OpenClaw

Your config files, memory, and skills work without modification.

**1. Scaffold into a new directory**

```bash
npm create hybrid my-agent
cd my-agent
```

**2. Copy your OpenClaw files over**

```bash
cp /path/to/openclaw/SOUL.md   ./SOUL.md
cp /path/to/openclaw/AGENTS.md ./AGENTS.md
cp /path/to/openclaw/MEMORY.md ./MEMORY.md
cp -r /path/to/openclaw/memory ./memory
cp -r /path/to/openclaw/skills ./skills
```

**3. Add new skills** (optional)

```bash
hybrid skills add github:cloudflare/skills/wrangler
hybrid skills add github:you/my-skill
```

**4. Set your env vars**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in `.env`:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key    # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# XMTP identity — generate a wallet key for your agent
AGENT_WALLET_KEY=0x...
XMTP_ENV=production
```

**5. Register and run**

```bash
hybrid register    # one-time: registers your wallet on the XMTP network
hybrid dev
```

Your agent is reachable at its wallet address from any XMTP client. Send it a DM at [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat).

---

## Onboarding

When you first create a Hybrid agent, it includes a `BOOTSTRAP.md` file that defines the first-run onboarding experience.

### First Run

1. **Configure ACL** — Add your wallet address to `ACL.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Owners

   - 0xyour_wallet_address
   ```

2. **Start the agent**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Chat with your agent** — The agent will:
   - Ask about its identity (name, personality, emoji)
   - Learn about you (name, preferences, timezone)
   - Discuss boundaries and behavior
   - Delete `BOOTSTRAP.md` when complete

4. **Onboarding complete** — Your agent now has a unique identity!

### How It Works

- **Owner-only**: During onboarding, only the owner can interact with the agent
- **State tracking**: Progress is saved in `.hybrid/workspace-state.json`
- **Automatic completion**: The agent detects when `BOOTSTRAP.md` is deleted and marks onboarding complete
- **OpenClaw compatible**: Uses the same BOOTSTRAP.md format and flow

### Adding More Users

After onboarding, add more owners or guests to `ACL.md`:
- **Owners** can access all memory and modify agent configuration
- **Guests** get isolated memory and can only create their own user profile

### Multi-Tenant Profiles

Each user gets their own profile:
```
users/
├── 0xalice/
│   └── USER.md    ← Alice's preferences
└── 0xbob/
    └── USER.md    ← Bob's preferences
```

The agent maintains its identity (`IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`) across all users.

---

### Starting fresh

```bash
npm create hybrid my-agent
cd my-agent
cp .env.example .env   # fill in OPENROUTER_API_KEY and AGENT_WALLET_KEY
hybrid register
hybrid dev
```

---

## Memory

Hybrid has a 3-layer memory system. All three layers are indexed together into SQLite for unified search.

### Layer 1 — PARA Knowledge Graph

Structured entity storage inspired by the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/). The agent can create named entities in four buckets — `projects`, `areas`, `resources`, `archives` — and attach atomic facts to each one.

```
.hybrid/memory/life/
  areas/people/Alice/
    items.json     ← all facts, including superseded ones
    summary.md     ← hot + warm facts only, used for search indexing
```

Each fact has a **decay tier** based on how recently and how often it's been accessed:

| Tier | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| Hot | accessed in the last 7 days, or 5+ accesses in the last 14 days |
| Warm | accessed in the last 30 days, or 10+ total accesses |
| Cold | not accessed in 30+ days |

Cold facts are excluded from search and from `summary.md` — but never deleted. When a fact becomes outdated, **supersession** marks the old fact as `superseded` and links it to the new one. Both stay in `items.json` as a history trail.

### Layer 2 — Daily Log

An append-only chronological log. Each day gets its own file:

```
.hybrid/memory/logs/2026-03-02.md
```

The agent logs facts, decisions, and actions throughout a session. Entries are timestamped and tagged `[FACT]`, `[DECISION]`, or `[ACTION]`. Nothing is ever rewritten — the file only grows.

### Layer 3 — Auto Memory

A structured `MEMORY.md` with five fixed sections: **User Preferences**, **Learnings**, **Decisions**, **Context**, **Notes**. The agent appends dated bullet points to the relevant section as it learns things about the user.

### Per-User Isolation

Every user's memory is scoped to their wallet address:

```
.hybrid/memory/users/0xabc.../MEMORY.md    ← guest's private memory
MEMORY.md                                  ← shared memory (owners only)
```

Access control is defined in `ACL.md` at the project root:

```markdown
## Owners

- 0xabc123...    # Added 2026-03-01
```

Owners can read all memory — shared, per-user, and the `memory/` directory. Guests only read and write their own slice. If there's no `ACL.md`, everyone is a guest.

### Search

Queries run both **vector search** (semantic, via sqlite-vec) and **BM25 keyword search** (FTS5) in parallel. Results are merged with a 70/30 weighting by default and filtered by a minimum relevance score. If no embedding provider is configured, it falls back to keyword-only.

---

## Scheduler

The scheduler lets the agent take action on a time-based trigger — run a cron job, fire after an interval, or execute once at a specific time. Jobs are persisted to SQLite and survive restarts.

### Schedule Types

```typescript
// One-time — fires once at a specific time
{ kind: "at", at: "2026-03-15T09:00:00Z" }

// Interval — fires every N milliseconds
{ kind: "every", everyMs: 3_600_000 }  // every hour

// Cron — standard cron expression with optional timezone
{ kind: "cron", expr: "0 9 * * 1-5", tz: "America/New_York" }
```

### How It Works

The scheduler uses precise `setTimeout` calls — it computes the exact millisecond of the next job and sleeps until then. There's no fixed polling loop. A maintenance heartbeat runs at most every 60 seconds to handle edge cases.

When a job fires, the scheduler sends the agent an **agent turn** — a message it processes just like a user message. The agent's response can optionally be delivered to a recipient via a channel adapter (e.g. sent as an XMTP message).

```typescript
// Example job payload
{
  kind: "agentTurn",
  message: "Send the daily summary to the team",
  delivery: {
    mode: "announce",
    channel: "xmtp",
    to: "0xrecipient..."
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

Failed jobs back off exponentially before retrying:

| Consecutive failures | Delay before retry |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | 30 seconds |
| 2 | 1 minute |
| 3 | 5 minutes |
| 4 | 15 minutes |
| 5+ | 1 hour |

Jobs that appear stuck (running for more than 2 hours) are automatically unstuck on the next scheduler start.
